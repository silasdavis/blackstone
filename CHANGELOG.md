- Version [0.6.0](#v0.6.0)
- Version [0.6.1](#v0.6.1)
 
## <a name="v0.6.1">Release v0.6.1</a>

Release 0.6.1 is a patch release on top of the 0.6.0 release to add an environment variable for the Postgres DB schema and fix a gap in the API that prevented support of the new parameter type `POSITIVE_NUMBER` that was added in release 0.6.0.


## <a name="v0.6.0">Release v0.6.0</a>

This release contains larger changes around data mappings and process model parameters. Process models using the `NUMBER` parameter type must be upgraded under certain conditions (see Breaking Changes below).

### Compatibility

This release was tested with the following software and versions:

|                    |        |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| Hyperledger Burrow | 0.23.3 |
| Solc               | 0.4.25 |

### Breaking Changes

- The modifier `AbstractUpgradeable.pre_higherVersionOnly(address)` was changed to revert rather than simply return if the passed Versioned contract is of a smaller version.
- Deleted contract `agreements/ParameterTypesAccess.sol` and moved the enum for parameter types into `commons-utils/DataTypesAccess.sol`.
- Changed the XML process model and bpm-parser.js to use different format for activity data mapping IDs. Added new INOUT direction value to make it easier to use a single data mapping for connecting the same data field as input and output.
- Changed the GET /bpm/activity-instances response attribute for data mappings `accessPointId` to `dataMappingId` and enhanced the data information with the `parameterType`.
- Changed the API to translate `NUMBER` parameter types into `int` instead of `uint`. The new `POSITIVE_NUMBER` parameter type now connect to `uint`. Process models that used NUMBER parameters in data mappings to applications requiring a `uint` (e.g. TotalCounterCheck, NumberIncrementor, NumberDecrementor) must be upgraded to use POSITIVE_NUMBER or they will not work as expected!

### Features / Bug Fixes

- Added support for Hyperledger Burrow 0.23.3
- Fixed a bug in contracts-controller.js to use the completeActivityWithData function correctly and complete an ActivityInstance with single data in one transaction
- Added performer name to GET /bpm/activity-instances response
- Allow external users to register for an account address only via email
- Updated GET /bpm/process-definitions route to add optional query params
- Added storage of data definitions access functions in `bpm-model/DefaultProcessModel.sol`. The data parameters from the XML process model are now persisted in the ProcessModel and exported to a new Vent table PROCESS_MODEL_DATA
- Added 4 new parameter types to `common/monax-constants.js` and `commons-utils/DataTypesAccess.sol`: BYTES32, DOCUMENT, LARGE_TEXT, POSITIVE_NUMBER
- Improved API with ability to add your custom middleware to the blackstone API. Also added the ability to accept a custom passport config.
- Added support for external users to execute IN/OUT data mappings on activities
- Upgraded `bpm-model/DefaultProcessModelRepository.sol` to version 1.1.0 in order to support an upgrade to changed contracts `DefaultProcessModel` and `DefaultProcessDefinition` which adds events for data-mapping information that populates the new Vent table `DATA_MAPPINGS`. An upgrade script for existing deployments `contracts/upgrade/ProcessModelRepository-1.1.0.yaml` was added.


## <a name="v0.5.2">Release v0.5.2</a>

### Compatibility

This release was tested with the following software and versions:

|                    |        |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| Hyperledger Burrow | 0.23.1 |
| Solc               | 0.4.25 |

### Breaking Changes

- The function `ActiveAgreementRegistry.startFormation(ActiveAgreement)` was renamed to `startProcessLifecycle(ActiveAgreement)` and the returned ProcessInstance address can now represent a started Formation or Execution process or be empty, depending on the setup of the Archetype (see Features below).

### Features

- The `DefaultArchetypeRegistry.createArchetype` function now allows the `_formationProcess` and `_executionProcess` parameters to be empty, thus adding support for archetypes with optional business process setups. IMPORTANT: Agreements created from archetypes that do not have Formation and/or Execution processes are responsible for their legal state changes. Especially for agreements without an execution process, these agreements will no longer switch their legal state to "fulfilled" automatically!</br>
Agreements without a formation process who want to run an execution process must be fully executed (which can be achieved by all signatories calling the `sign()` function on the agreement) **before** calling `ActiveAgreementRegistry.startProcessLifecycle(ActiveAgreement)`.
- User activation via email for new user accounts has been added. A new user signing up via the API is by default "deactivated" and has to click on the activation link in an email before being able to login for the first time. This serves to validate the user's email account used for notifications, etc.


## <a name="v0.5.1">Release v0.5.1</a>

### Compatibility

This release was tested with the following software and versions:

|                    |        |
| :----------------- | :----- |
| Hyperledger Burrow | 0.23.1 |
| Solc               | 0.4.25 |

### Breaking Changes

- The `UserAccount` contract has been turned into a DelegateProxy capable of forwarding calls. No longer needed specialized contracts `WorkflowUserAccount` and `AgreementPartyAccount` have been removed.
- Several functions (`getInData...`, `setOutData...`, `completeActivityWith...`) have been moved from BpmService (and former `WorkflowUserAccount`) to the `ProcessInstance`. This greatly improves application building since it's no longer required to wire the BpmService into an application and deploy it in DOUG like a service. 
-  The function signature of the complete function of an `Application` has been changed to include the address of the `ProcessInstance`: `function complete(address _processInstance, bytes32 _activityInstanceId, bytes32 _activityId, address _txPerformer)`.
-  The use of fixed-size arrays has been replaced with dynamic arrays in contracts `DataStorage` and `Organization`.

### Features

- Removed SQLsol mechanism using a memory database (SQLite) as object cache and replaced it with a Postgres DB that is populated via Vent, a query/filter mechanism reading events directly from blocks retrieved from Burrow.
- The Blackstone Node app now provides a way to pass an existing HTTP server upon startup to which all routes and endpoints are added. This allows to use Blackstone embedded in other applications.
- The BPM model now supports process diagrams with two gateways connected directly to each other with the explicit addition of an empty activity between them.
- The JSON response of the API endpoint `GET /agreements/:address` has been enhanced to resemble more closely the data of an archetype by adding documents, parameter type, and process definitions.


### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug in API layer where transition conditions in the BPM Model based on uint values were skewed due to passing the value to burrow.js as string.
- Fixed problem in `BpmRuntimeLib` contract regarding the treatment a process graph with a loop where an already traversed node was not reset to be used again.
- Fixed a bug in the API when parsing and deploying a process model and the placeholder `PROCESS_INSTANCE` in the model was not removed as a dataStorageId prior to setting transition conditions in the smart contracts leading transition conditions relying on the ProcessInstance's data storage to revert.
